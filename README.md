section-markdown
================

This is a plugin for [Section, a static site generator](http://section.iclanzan.com), that parses markdown.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires the `~0.1.0` version of the [grunt-section](https://github.com/iclanzan/grunt-section) plugin.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. You may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install section-markdown --save
```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
